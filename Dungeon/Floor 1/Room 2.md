# Fountain

To the north of the Entrance is a fountain with a statue of a woman pouring water from a Decanter.

A DC 15 Insight check reveals the Decanter to be a Decanter of Endless Water.

If the party tries to walk towards the Statue, the are pushed away by the water.

Freezing the water with a cold damage cantrip or spell, or by reaching the statue without touching the water allows the party to take the Decanter of Endless Water for themselves.

Taking the Decanter of Endless Water causes the fountain to drain rapidly, draining the water in the entire level.
